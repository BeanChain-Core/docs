# BeanChain Overview

**BeanChain** is a modular, transparent blockchain ecosystem built for speed, flexibility, and developer empowerment. Its layered architecture, extensible transaction system, and open node design support both on-chain and off-chain logic ‚Äî including multi-language smart contracts, Layer 2 tokens, and community-hosted infrastructure.

> Currently in devnet ‚Äî powered by a growing set of tools, nodes, and SDKs maintained by the **BeanChain Core Team** under **Outlandish Tech**, a division of **Outlandish Creative LLC**.

## Core Architecture

BeanChain‚Äôs network is built on a layered node system designed for flexibility and scalability:

- **GPN ‚Äì Genesis Public Node**  
  The root public node. Anchors the network with block history and transaction gossiping.

- **PN ‚Äì Public Node**  
  Open to external apps and wallets. Hosts public endpoints for submitting transactions and syncing.

- **RN ‚Äì Reward Node**  
  Issues system-level transactions (faucet, validator rewards, airdrops) and tracks validator trust via ping/pong.

- **CEN ‚Äì Contract Execution Node** *(in development)*  
  Handles off-chain smart contract logic and submits results as verified Layer 1 or Layer 2 TXs.

- **Historical Node** *(in development)*  
  SQL-based node that stores full block history for use in explorers and external integrations.

> Peripheral nodes like the RN, CEN, and Historical Node are designed to be **customizable**, allowing developers to plug in their own tools or logic while remaining network-compatible.

## Key Features

- **Custom Transaction Flags**  
  Native support for TX types like `transfer`, `reward`, `mint`, `contractCall`, `fundedCENCALL`, and more.

- **Off-Chain Execution with CENs**  
  Efficient, scalable contract logic processed outside consensus and verified by nodes.

- **Layer 2 Token Engine**  
  Mint, burn, and transfer custom tokens with balances tracked in a separate Layer2DB.

- **Developer-Built Nodes**  
  The network supports oracles, bots, analytics relays, and more via custom node builds.

- **Multi-Language Contract Support** *(WIP)*  
  Java support is live; Go, Python, and JS are on the roadmap via community SDKs (e.g., `goPack`).

- **Shared SDKs**  
  [`BeanPack-Java`](https://github.com/BeanChain-Core/BeanPack-Java) powers core models, TX validation, cryptographic tools, and serialization logic.
